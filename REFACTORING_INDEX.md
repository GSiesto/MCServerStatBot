## 🛠️ Implementation Roadmap

```
Week 1-2:   Milestone 1 - Foundation & Dependencies ✅
Week 3-5:   Milestone 2 - Service Layer Separation ✅
Week 6-7:   Milestone 3 - Containerization ✅
Week 8-10:  Milestone 4 - Microservices Split ✅
Week 11-13: Milestone 5 - AWS Integration ✅
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:      8-13 weeks (2-3 months)
```

**Note:** Deployment to AWS (infrastructure setup) is not included in this plan. This refactoring prepares the *application* for AWS; actual infrastructure deployment (CDK/Terraform) is future work.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to read all documents?
**A:** No! Start with **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md**. If you need more detail, move to **REFACTORING_PLAN.md** or **ARCHITECTURE.md** based on your role.

### Q: Can I implement the plan in a different order?
**A:** Milestones 1-2 must be completed first (foundation). Milestones 3-5 can be partially parallelized but are designed to build on each other.

### Q: Is AWS deployment included?
**A:** No. This plan refactors the *application* to be AWS-ready. Infrastructure deployment (CDK/Terraform, ECS cluster setup, VPC creation) is separate future work.

### Q: What if I want to use GCP or Azure instead?
**A:** The microservices architecture is cloud-agnostic. Replace AWS-specific services:
- ECS Fargate → GKE/AKS
- DynamoDB → Firestore/Cosmos DB
- ElastiCache → Cloud Memorystore/Azure Cache for Redis
- CloudWatch → Cloud Logging/Azure Monitor

### Q: Can I skip testing?
**A:** Not recommended. Tests ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality and make future changes safer. Aim for >80% coverage.

### Q: How much will AWS cost?
**A:** See **ARCHITECTURE.md** → "Cost Estimation". Estimate ~$118/month for 10K users, 50K commands/day. Use Fargate Spot for ~70% savings.
